Deep Learning project using Tensorflow
Problem statement: Identifying the breed of dog based on the image input of dog
Dataset: Dataset is used from kaggle website
Evaluation: Evaluation is file with prediction probability for each dog breed of each test image
Model Used: "https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification/4"
Steps:
Getting Data Insights
  Importing required libraries.
  Reading data using `pd.read_csv`
  getting data insight
  Displayed imapge using `IPython, Image`
  Found Uniques breeds
  Converted breeds into boolean array
  Created own validation dataset
Image Processing
  Converted images into tensors
  Preproceesed the images ( resize, channels manipulation)
Created Data Batches
  Shuffles the training data but not validation data.
  Visualizing Images
Building a Model
  Imported Sequential model from tf.keras
  Activation function used: 'Softmax'
  Compiled model:
                losses=CategoricalCrossEntropy,
                optimizer="Adam",
                metrics used ="accuracy

    Used TensorBoard CallBacks for monitoring training process
    Trained model in small set of data 
Prediction and Visualisation
    Made prediction and visualised if predicted value matches with true value.
Saved model.
Trained the saved model on full data and got accuracy of 99.91 with loss value 0.0085
Returned output in the form the breed id and prediction probability of each breed.
